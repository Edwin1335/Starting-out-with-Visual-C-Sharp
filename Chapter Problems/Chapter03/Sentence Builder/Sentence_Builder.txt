The form in Figure 3-47 contains buttons showing various words, phrases, and
punctuation. Create an application with a form similar to this one. When the application runs, 
the user clicks the buttons to build a sentence, which is shown in a Label control. You can use 
the same buttons as shown in the figure or make up your own. The Reset button should clear the 
sentence so the user can start over.
